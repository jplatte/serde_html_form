# `serde_html_form`

(De-)serialization support for the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.

This crate is a Rust library for serialising to and deserialising from
the [`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`][urlencoded] format. It is built
upon [Serde], a high performance generic serialization framework and [rust-url],
a URL parser for Rust.

It is a fork of [`serde_urlencoded`], with additional support for maps or
structs with fields of sequence type (e.g. `Vec<String>`). It also supports
`Option` in values, treating `foo=` as `foo: None`.

⚠️ For vectors that may be empty, it is best to use a `Vec` with the
`#[serde(default)]` attribute, as the combination `Option<Vec<_>>` will
often not work as expected.
